# Human Impacts of Infrastructure Improvements

## Milestones

- May 15: orals scheduling deadline

## To-Dos

### Sharpen the Research Question

- [ ] Define the treatment
- [X] Define the outcome variables to use
- [X] Characterize its economic significance. Why is this more than just a policy evaluation?
	- _spatial equilibrium_
	- Amenity valuation/capitalization into housing prices
	- Distributional analysis: who benefits and who loses

### Develop the Analytic Strategy

- [X] Define the unit of analysis
- [ ] Understand the available power
	- Is there enough useable projects in the ATP program?
	- Are there [other programs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TxLO-5f8JYMfYBA36-aJs-UnfBgDcFMiNtmClkDimLU/edit#gid=0) that can be used or combined for the same set of projects?
- [ ] define the econometric approach

### Data Work

#### ATP Data

- [ ] Get data on the unfunded projects
- [ ] Download and merge the other years' projects
- [ ] Merge in project scores
- [ ] Get data on project status and actual construction dates
- [ ] Define GIS/location data for each project

#### Outcome Data

- [ ] Access Safegraph Data
	- [X] Download Safegraph data
	- [X] Identify structure and needed variables
	- [ ] Match Safegraph data to project locations
- [ ] ~~Access Strava data~~
	- [X] Contact Strava for data access: **Strava denied my data request**
- [ ] Access TIMS/SWITRS crash data
- [ ] Access traffic data
	- [X] Contact Streetlight about data access
	- [ ] Sign data access agreement with Streetlight
	- [ ] Download and explore traffic data
- [ ] Access hospital data
	- [ ] Download hospital Data
	- [ ] Explore location matching possibilities
- [ ] Access transit on-time performance data
- [ ] Find air quality data
	- [X] Talk to Joe about potential data sources
	- [ ] Read Fowlie, Rubin, and Walker 2019 on remote sensing data
	- [ ] Find PurpleAir or vehicle-based air quality data

### [Other Funding Programs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TxLO-5f8JYMfYBA36-aJs-UnfBgDcFMiNtmClkDimLU/edit#gid=0)

- [X] Identify Metropolitan Planning Organizations in California with similar funding mechanisms
- [X] Look for other states with similar funding mechanisms
- [X] Look for federal funding programs with similar RD structure

### Building Towards ERE/Orals

- [X] Summarize causal question(s)
- [ ] Develop summary tables for infrastructure projects and outcome data
- [X] Use a single project as a presentation case study
- [ ] Literature review
- [X] Summarize the scope of funding programs that can be used for identification, power calculations
- [ ] Identify an external committee member

- [X] ERE Slides
	- Big Picture motivation: Incidence and distributional impacts of these projects
	- Specific research question: Impact of [streetscape changes] on [outcomes]
	- Example project
		- Overview of information
		- Maps
		- Timeline
	- Description of existing data
	- Preliminary discussion of power, if possible
