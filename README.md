# Human Impacts of Infrastructure Improvements

## Milestones

- August 1: orals

## To-Dos

### Sharpen the Research Question

- [ ] Define the treatment
- [X] Define the outcome variables to use
- [X] Characterize its economic significance. Why is this more than just a policy evaluation?
	- _spatial equilibrium_
	- Amenity valuation/capitalization into housing prices
	- Distributional analysis: who benefits and who loses

### Develop the Analytic Strategy

- [X] Define the unit of analysis
- [ ] Understand the available power
	- Are there enough useable projects in the ATP program?
	- Are there [other programs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TxLO-5f8JYMfYBA36-aJs-UnfBgDcFMiNtmClkDimLU/edit#gid=0) that can be used or combined for the same set of projects?
- [ ] understand MPO funding component; whether their processes can fit into a multi-score/multi-cutoff RD framework
- [ ] Dig more into continuity framework vs. local randomization framework for RD (relevant for discrete running variables)

### Data Work

#### ATP Data

- [X] Get data on the unfunded projects
- [X] Download and merge the other years' projects
- [X] Merge in project scores
- [ ] Get project location data (from application packets)
- [ ] Get data from rounds 1 and 2
- [ ] Get data on project status and actual construction dates
- [ ] Define GIS/location data for each project

#### Outcome Data

- [ ] Access Safegraph Data
	- [X] Download Safegraph data
	- [X] Identify structure and needed variables
	- [ ] Match Safegraph data to project locations
- [ ] ~~Access Strava data~~
	- [X] Contact Strava for data access: **Strava denied my data request**
- [ ] Access TIMS/SWITRS crash data
- [ ] Access traffic data
	- [X] Contact Streetlight about data access
	- [ ] Decide what traffic data I'm using
	- [ ] Sign data access agreement with Streetlight
	- [ ] Download and explore traffic data
- [ ] Access hospital data
	- [ ] Download hospital Data
	- [ ] Explore location matching possibilities
- [ ] Access transit on-time performance data
- [ ] Find air quality data
	- [X] Talk to Joe about potential data sources
	- [ ] Read Fowlie, Rubin, and Walker 2019 on remote sensing data
	- [ ] Find PurpleAir or vehicle-based air quality data

### [Other Funding Programs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TxLO-5f8JYMfYBA36-aJs-UnfBgDcFMiNtmClkDimLU/edit#gid=0)

- [X] Identify Metropolitan Planning Organizations in California with similar funding mechanisms
- [X] Look for other states with similar funding mechanisms
- [X] Look for federal funding programs with similar RD structure

### Building Towards ERE/Orals

- [X] Summarize causal question(s)
- [X] Develop summary tables for infrastructure projects and outcome data
- [X] Use a single project as a presentation case study
- [X] Literature review
	- Focus on tying into the key economic question, and its place in that literature
- [X] Summarize the scope of funding programs that can be used for identification, power calculations
- [X] Identify an external committee member

### Orals Components

- [ ] Prospectus
	- When sending prospectus, offer to meet with orals faculty members prior to orals date
- [ ] Presentation
	- aim for ~30 minutes of me talking, will be lots of interruptions and questions
