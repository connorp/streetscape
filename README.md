# Human Impacts of Infrastructure Improvements

## Milestones

- April 6: ERE Presentation
- May 15: orals scheduling deadline

## To-Dos

### Conceptual Questions to Answer

- [ ] Define the unit of analysis
- [ ] Define the treatment
- [ ] Understand the available power
	- Is there enough useable projects in the ATP program?
	- Are there other programs that can be used or combined for the same set of projects?
- [ ] define the econometric approach

### Data Work

#### ATP Data

- [ ] Get data on the unfunded projects
- [ ] Download and merge the other years' projects
- [ ] Merge in project scores
- [ ] Get data on project status and actual construction dates
- [ ] Define GIS/location data for each project

#### Outcome Data

- [ ] Access Safegraph Data
	- [X] Download Safegraph data
	- [ ] Identify structure and needed variables
	- [ ] Match Safegraph data to project locations
- [ ] Access Strava data
	- [X] Contact Strava for data access
	- [ ] Download/query Strava Data
	- [ ] Identify structure and needed variables
	- [ ] Match data to project locations
- [ ] Access TIMS/SWITRS crash data
- [ ] Access hospital data
	- [ ] Meet with Reed
	- [ ] Download hospital Data
	- [ ] Explore location matching possibilities
- [ ] Access transit on-time performance Data
- [ ] Find air quality data
	- [ ] Talk to Joe about potential data sources
- [ ] Access traffic data (Streetlight, TomTom)
	- [X] Contact Streetlight about data access
	- [ ] Contact TomTom about data access
	- [ ] Identify cities/DOTs who might provide access to INRIX data

### Other Funding Programs

- [ ] Identify Metropolitan Planning Organizations in California with similar funding mechanisms
- [ ] Look for other states with similar funding mechanisms
- [ ] Look for federal funding programs with similar RD structure

### Building Towards ERE/Orals

- [ ] Summarize causal question(s)
- [ ] Develop summary tables for infrastructure projects and outcome data
- [ ] Use a single project as a presentation case study
- [ ] Literature review
- [ ] Summarize the scope of funding programs that can be used for identification, power calculations
